            <p>Retailers are eyeing consumer spending behavior as U.S. households feel the squeeze from inflation, 
               higher gas prices, and rising interest rates. "The consumer is the pulse of the U.S. economy, and trying 
               to understand what's happening in real time, I think, is critical," Mastercard Chief U.S. Economist Michelle 
               Meyer told Yahoo Finance (video above). Retail sales — a measure of spending at stores, online, and in restaurants
               — fell 0.3% in May, marking the first decline in five months, the Commerce Department said last Wednesday.
               The plunge was driven in large part by a sharp drop in car purchases as vehicles and borrowing became expensive. 
               Excluding autos and gasoline, retail sales rose just 0.1% in May, well behind the pace for last month. Data also 
               showed a slowdown in online shopping with a 0.1% decline in activity during the month.
